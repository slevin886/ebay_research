### ebay market research web app  

#### About
Genius Bidding is a full-featured web application for conducting market research on ebay. 
Built with python, flask, postgres, js and lots of pandas, the site allows a registered and 
logged in user to get aggregate data and statistics (including: price trends, market size, item characteristics) 
from customizable search queries (e.g. Fender Guitars, priced under $1000, used only). The site allows users to set 
recurring searches and easily track when prices rise/fall in a given marketplace or the characteristics of 
items sold changes.

 #### Design 
 
 The site was previously deployed on elastic beanstalk and is designed to write to S3 (i.e. uses boto).
